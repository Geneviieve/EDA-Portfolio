# EDA Portfolio
I’ll say this once: no model will ever run smoothly without well-balanced, clean, and properly preprocessed data. Models depend on the quality of their inputs, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the stage where that foundation is built.

This portfolio is dedicated to documenting my EDA projects. Here I focus on:

    1. Data Cleaning: handling missing values, fixing inconsistencies, and ensuring valid formats
    2. Data Exploration: using descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies
    3. Feature Understanding: identifying relationships between variables and their potential impact on downstream tasks
    4. Data Preparation: creating well-structured, ready-to-use datasets for machine learning or analytical models

EDA shapes the accuracy, fairness, and efficiency of any model that follows. The work showcased here highlights the critical role of systematic analysis and preprocessing before modeling.

This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks, all collected in one place for easier reference and learning. Each notebook explores a different dataset, where I go through the process of cleaning, preparing, and examining the data step by step.

By wrapping these EDA notebooks together, I aim to build a space that shows my progress and approach to data analysis in a clear and transparent way to practice and document the thought process, starting from understanding the raw data, identifying patterns and relationships, and finally presenting insights through visualizations and simple statistical methods. It’s less about presenting polished results, and more about sharing how I work with data, what I learn along the way, and how different datasets bring out different kinds of questions and stories.
